                        <p>Excellent Habit App is Mobile Apps that will help people to build an excellent habit</p>
                        <p>How to use it:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Every morning, you would run wizard. It will allow you to "brain dump" that you have to do all day.</li>
                            <li>Wizard will allow you to set the priority of every task. you can DO IT, SCHEDULE IT, DELETE IT or DELEGATE IT"</li>
                            <li>Run wizard once in the morning</li>
                            <li>And through the day, you can focus to complete the task list you created from wizard</li>
                            <li>It happens when suddenly something come up into your mind. Or your bos suddenly ask you to do something. That's the time to use the dream capture</li>
                            <li>Dream capture is an effective way to write anything that come up to you, while you are focusing to HIT target finishing your today task list</li>
                            <li>Tomorrow, when you run the wizard again, your dream capture list will show and you can set the priority (DO IT, SCHEDULE IT, DELETE IT or DELEGATE IT)</li>
                        </ol>
